# paladinsLive

## Description:
Application to view Live Paladins Match Statistics on both teams.

## How to use:
Type in a player username and make sure to hit enter for the program to check if the name is valid. Then press the
"continue" button. For now, the friends list feature is not functioning but if the player is currently in a match then hitting the "Live
Match" will make the program attempt to view both teams player stats of the current match.

### Shortcuts:
Right now there are two shortcuts that can be used to use the program more efficiently. There is the "Esc" button that will go back instead
of manually hitting the back button. As well as the "Refresh" button that will refresh the Live Match. This is useful if the player is in
a new match or if there might be a bot in the match.
